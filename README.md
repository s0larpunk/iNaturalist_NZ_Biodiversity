# Biodiversity Assessment in New Zealand: A Citizen Science Perspective
This project was conducted as part of the Open Science course of the Master AIRE at the Learning Planet Institute in Paris. The project was conducted by a team of students: Maxim Velli, Tarek Nouneh, Lola Kengen and Eva Koskova. 

# Navigating the code
The code is divided into three main sections: data cleaning, saturation curve analysis and biodiversity analysis. The data cleaning section is further divided into two parts: the first part (in main.ipynb) is dedicated to the import and cleaning of data from iNaturalist and NZTCS. Both of the used datasets are stored in the data folder. The date and source of retrieval can be found in the Bibliography section.

In the saturation curve analysis section we plotted saturation curves for the entire iNaturalist dataset, as well as wrote a function that plots the saturation curve per kingdom. We also calculated biodiversity estimates using the Chao1, Chao2, and ACE methods. 

In the biodiversity analysis section we plotted the distribution of observed species per kingdom and compared it to the distribution of species in the NZTCS. The statistical analysis was performed by approximating the distribution as a binomial.

In dataviz_animals and dataviz_plants notebooks we performed a visual comparison of the number of species distribution for 10 most relevant orders/classes/phyla between iNaturalist and NZTCS. Due to misalignment between the two datasets, we could not perform a statistical analysis on this data.

# Data
The data used in this project was obtained from iNaturalist and NZTCS. The iNaturalist data was obtained from the GBIF database. The data was downloaded on 31st January 2024. The data was filtered to only include observations from New Zealand.
